Hi

Notes:

- Look up Bulma - supposedly a CSS framework that is an alternative to boostrap since there is this weird thing in my head telling me not to use bootstrap.
-- For anyone asking why - my goal is to make websites with the least amount of JavaScript as possible because it is a terrible language I don't want to write in and I don't know anything so we gonna try and make shit as basic as possible :)
--- Alternatives: Rust Yew & WebAssembly. Maybe in the future I'll Rust-ify this once I learn Rust and finish this... dang that's a lot

- I want to make a page about tipping - I feel like this application emphasizes that the livelihood of delivery drivers relies on tipping from the customer when in reality companies like DoorDash and UberEats do not give delivery drivers enough money. HOWEVER, I personally believe that there should be a balance between tipping, where the employees get a liveable wage but also be rewarded for being good people ( in person restaurants ) or going out of their way to deliver their food to you.
