Hi

Notes:

- Look up Bulma - supposedly a CSS framework that is an alternative to boostrap since there is this weird thing in my head telling me not to use bootstrap.

- I want to make a page about tipping - I feel like this application emphasizes that tipping and the livelihood of delivery drivers relies on tipping from the customer when in reality companies like DoorDash and UberEats do not give delivery drivers enough money. HOWEVER, I personally believe that there should be a balance between tipping, where the employees get a liveable wage but also be rewarded for being good people ( in person restaurants ) or going out of their way to deliver their food to you.
